Human Computer Interaction Practice
=====

The HCI Lab was focussed on the nuances of actual and perceived human behaviour towards the computer systems.
In this Lab, some experiments were conducted to verify some laws like [Fitt's Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts's_law), [Hick Heyman's Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hick's_law) and some effects like the [Serial Positioning Effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_position_effect). Following is the list of the experiments conducted in the course of the lab.

* CAPTCHA Evaluation ( Text CAPTCHAs, reCAPTCHA, Image CAPTCHA etc.)
* QWERTY and DVORAK Keyboard Layout Comparison
* New Dashing UI for Railway Ticketing System ( After being frustated with [IRCTC](https://www.irctc.co.in/) :) )
* Serial Positioning Effect
* Fitt's Law
* Dynamic Menu Creation by scraping of the ESPN Sports Website's Menu Items
* Hick Hyman's Law
* Download Manager with UI involving Auditory responses in addition to the Visual ones.
* Mobile Keypad to illustrate its UI and Usage.
